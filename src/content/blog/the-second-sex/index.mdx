*The Second Sex* (1949) is the most influential work of feminist philosophy ever written. Simone de Beauvoir applies existentialist philosophy to analyze the situation of women, revealing how female identity has been constructed to serve male interests.

## "One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman"

This famous statement captures Beauvoir's central insight. Biological sex does not determine social role. "Woman" is a cultural construction—a set of expectations, limitations, and myths imposed by patriarchal society.

> "Representation of the world, like the world itself, is the work of men; they describe it from their own point of view, which they confuse with absolute truth."

## The Other

Drawing on Hegel, Beauvoir shows how women have been defined as "Other" to man's "Subject." Men are the default, the universal, the essential. Women are derivative, particular, inessential.

This explains why history is largely the history of men, why "human" experience defaults to male experience, and why women struggle for recognition of their full humanity.

## Situation and Freedom

As an existentialist, Beauvoir believes humans are fundamentally free. But freedom is always exercised within a situation—social, economic, bodily constraints. Women's situation has severely limited their exercise of freedom.

Yet situation is not destiny. Understanding how "woman" is constructed opens the possibility of reconstruction. Women can claim subjectivity and freedom.

## Lasting Impact

*The Second Sex* launched second-wave feminism and remains essential reading. Its analysis of how gender is socially constructed anticipated much contemporary gender theory.

More broadly, it models how philosophy can illuminate concrete social problems and contribute to liberation.
