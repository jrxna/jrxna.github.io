*Leviathan* (1651), written during the English Civil War, offers one of history's most powerful arguments for political authority. Hobbes begins with a stark vision of human nature and builds a case for absolute sovereignty.

## The State of Nature

Without government, humans exist in a "state of nature" characterized by perpetual conflict. Resources are scarce, humans are roughly equal in power, and there is no common authority to enforce agreements.

> "The life of man [in the state of nature is] solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short."

This is not merely speculation about prehistoric times. Whenever authority breaks down—in civil war, between nations—the state of nature returns.

## The Social Contract

To escape this condition, rational individuals agree to surrender their natural freedom to a sovereign power. This "social contract" creates the Leviathan—the state—which has absolute authority to maintain peace.

Key features:
- The contract is between individuals, not with the sovereign
- Once established, the sovereign cannot be legitimately overthrown
- The sovereign's authority covers all aspects of public life

## Materialist Psychology

Hobbes grounds his politics in a mechanistic view of human nature. We are driven by desires and aversions, seeking power to secure future satisfaction. Reason is instrumental, calculating means to ends.

## Lasting Significance

Though few accept Hobbes's conclusions, his questions remain central: Why should we obey the state? What justifies political authority? What are the alternatives to order?

*Leviathan* established social contract theory as a dominant framework in political philosophy and continues to provoke debate about power, freedom, and security.
